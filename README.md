# Performance

Assuming you have SBT (http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) installed just clone the repository, go into the directory and use: 

    sbt update eclipse

which will create the necessary files to import your project into Eclipse. When you're ready try:

    sbt jetty-run

to run your creation in Jetty!
